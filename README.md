# Chat
Small chat application in Java with E2EE.

## Usage
- To use this program run the `.jar` file: `java -jar /path/to/file.jar`.
- Specify if you're hosting the chat session or if you're connecting to someone else's session.

### Host
1. To host a session you'll have to select the "H" option at the start.
2. You must then specify a port to host the session on (make sure this port isn't in use by other applications).
3. Now you can just simply wait for a client to connect, and your session will begin.

### Client
1. To join a session you must select the "c" option at the start.
2. You must know the public IPv4 adress of the host and the port used by the host.
3. You can now start the chat.
